**Note** - `In the development of this project, we have harnessed the capabilities of the free version of the Spoonacular API. It's worth noting that the free version comes with certain daily usage limits. If you encounter any errors related to these limits while using our platform, there's a simple solution: Register for an account on the official Spoonacular API website and obtain your unique API key. Then, to seamlessly address this issue within our project, proceed to the 'frontend/src/assets/URL/API_KEY' directory. Here, you can replace the existing API key with the one you've acquired.`
